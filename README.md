# House-Prediction-Project-
This repository contains all the code, data, and documentation for a machine learning project focused on predicting house prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and implementing different predictive models. The project is structured to walk through the entire data science process, from data collection to model deployment, with a focus on accuracy, interpretability, and scalability.

**Project Overview**
The primary objective of this project is to predict house prices based on a wide range of features including, but not limited to, location, size, number of bedrooms, and proximity to amenities. By leveraging historical data and applying machine learning algorithms, this project aims to create a robust model capable of providing accurate price predictions, which can be valuable for both buyers and sellers in the real estate market.

**Key Components**
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and includes comprehensive information about houses and their selling prices.
Preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features to ensure the data is ready for modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

A thorough EDA is conducted to understand the underlying patterns and relationships within the data.
Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices are used to explore feature distributions and interactions.
Feature Engineering:

New features are engineered based on domain knowledge and insights gained from the EDA.
Techniques such as polynomial features, interaction terms, and feature scaling are applied to enhance model performance.
Modeling:

Multiple machine learning algorithms are implemented and compared, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Model tuning is performed using cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization to select the best-performing model.
Metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared are used to evaluate model accuracy.

Model Interpretation:

The importance of each feature is analyzed to provide interpretability to the modelâ€™s predictions.
SHAP values and partial dependence plots are used to understand the influence of each feature on the predicted house prices.

Collaboration is encouraged, and contributions are welcome. Feel free to open issues, suggest improvements, or submit pull requests.
Future Work
Expanding the dataset to include more diverse regions and property types.
Conclusion
This project serves as a comprehensive guide for anyone looking to understand or implement a machine learning model for house price prediction. Whether you're a data scientist, a real estate professional, or a curious learner, this repository offers valuable insights and practical tools to build predictive models that can make a real impact in the housing market.
